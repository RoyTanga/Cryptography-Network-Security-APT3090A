Lab 1: Key Generation Algorithm Prime numbers      
Read about generation of random numbers, prime numbers and GCD Function.
Write a program using any Object oriented programming language to show generation of keys using prime numbers. The program should randomly pick two prime numbers from a given range, the first output random number is p and the second one is q 
Evaluation Criteria
1.	Random generation of prime numbers 
2.	Selection of two prime numbers - p, q
3.	Correctness of the code 
Lab 2: Euler’s Totient function
Read about relatively prime numbers, Eulers and totient 
Euler's theorem states that, “if p and q are relatively prime, then”, where φ is Euler's totient function for integers. That is, is the number of non-negative numbers that are less than q and relatively prime to q. Euler’s Totient function Φ(n) for an input n is count of numbers in {1, 2, 3, …, n} that are relatively prime to n, i.e., the numbers whose GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) with n is 1.
Modify Lab 1 program and write a program for finding Euler Totient Function Values  

Evaluation Criteria
1.	Random Generation of p, generation of Euler Totient Function Values 
2.	Prepare one lab report showing the code and the results (screenshots) and explanation of your two algorithms i.e. lab 1 and 2.

LAB 3:
1.	 Write a program using object oriented programming language to show the implementation of RSA Algorithm.
